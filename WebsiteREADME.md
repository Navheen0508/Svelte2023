# About my Website

I have chosen to do my website about a topic that I'm passionate about - Gundam. A Japanese franchise featuring giant mech suits piloted by humans who battle each other for inter-galactic supremacy, representing various different factions. 
Before I began coding my website I evaluated 3 sites which I wanted to incorporate elements of into my own. These websites belonged to the Destiny 2 game, Pierre's Ice Cream and a personal website by a web dev known as Cihad Turhan.

## Destiny 2

The inspiration for the nav bar and buttons across all my pages came from the Destiny 2 website. I liked how simple and clean it looked and also liked the underline hover effect when you hover over the buttons so I implemented this design aspect of the website into my own. 

## Pierre's Ice Cream

I decided that I wanted to have a slideshow as my main attraction for my home page and this was the website that made me appreciate the design of a slideshow the best as it looks tidy and fits well with the type of nav
bar that I was also planning to implement. The elements on the page are positioned well and situated nicely. This slideshow isn't automated though however, so I would like to make mine an animated slideshow instead.

Looking at this website, I really appreciated the 2 column style of layout that this web developer used for their website. It seemed simple enough to create but also looked like it would be a perfect for fitting content
easily into. Most of my pages will end up having 2 or 3 column layouts like this one with the content fitted inside them.
