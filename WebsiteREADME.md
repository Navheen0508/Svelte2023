# About my Website

I have chosen to do my website about a topic that I'm passionate about - Gundam. A Japanese franchise featuring giant mech suits piloted by humans who battle each other for inter-galactic supremacy, representing various different factions. 
Before I began coding my website I evaluated 3 sites which I wanted to incorporate elements of into my own. These websites belonged to the Destiny 2 game, Pierre's Ice Cream and a personal website by a web dev known as Cihad Turhan.

## Destiny 2

The inspiration for the nav bar and buttons across all my pages came from the Destiny 2 website. I liked simple and clean it looked and also liked the underline hover effect when you hover over the buttons so I implemented this design aspect of 
the website into my own.
