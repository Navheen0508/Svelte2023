# About my Website

I have chosen to do my website about a topic that I'm passionate about - Gundam. A Japanese franchise featuring giant mech suits piloted by humans who battle each other for inter-galactic supremacy, representing various different factions.  It will include content which promotoes the franchise (either their model kits or the shows and games).
Before I began coding my website I evaluated 3 sites which I wanted to incorporate elements of into my own. These websites belonged to the Destiny 2 game, Pierre's Ice Cream and a personal website by a web dev known as Cihad Turhan.

## Destiny 2

The inspiration for the nav bar and buttons across all my pages came from the Destiny 2 website. I liked how simple and clean it looked and also liked the underline hover effect when you hover over the buttons so I implemented this design aspect of the website into my own. 

## Pierre's Ice Cream

I decided that I wanted to have a slideshow as my main attraction for my home page and this was the website that made me appreciate the design of a slideshow the best as it looks tidy and fits well with the type of nav
bar that I was also planning to implement. The elements on the page are positioned well and situated nicely. This slideshow isn't automated though however, so I would like to make mine an animated slideshow instead.

## Cihad Turhan

Looking at this website, I really appreciated the 2 column style of layout that this web developer used for their website. It seemed simple enough to create but also looked like it would be a perfect for fitting content
easily into. Most of my pages will end up having 2 or 3 column layouts like this one with the content fitted inside them. 

## Technologies Used:

* **Visual Studio Code** - The software that I will be using for the coding of the site.
* **Svelte** - The framework that I will be working in.
* **Unsplash API** - For image fetching.
* **Postman** - To generate image queries which will fetch the Gundam images that I want to display on the site.
* **HTML** - I will be writing HTML code.
* **CSS** - I will be writing CSS code.
* **Javascript** - I will be using Javascript.

## Installation Guide:

1. Step 1 - Clone the repo from the link.

## Known Bugs:

* The slideshow on the homepage will transition to a previous slide in the queue in it's automatic mode as the next slide if you manually select a slide to go to that is further than the one you are currently on.
* The character selection script in the Mobile Suits page is not working - when the character buttons are clicked on, the image does not change to it's respective Mobile Suit. Only the name.
* The animated buttons on the Titles page do not go anywhere even though they are linked with a href in the code.
* Leaving the page open for a really long time on a different page other than the Home page might cause the automated slideshow feature to stop automatically transitioning.

## Future Roadmap:

In addition to fixing all of the bugs mentioned above - below are some features that I would like to add going forward:

* A search bar for the website.
* A better API to implement - such as the ones on Github which contain Gundam data.
* More interactive features such as more refined image galleries and video slideshows.
* Transition into a more complex modern design using more Javascript weighted code.
